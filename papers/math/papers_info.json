    "summary": "Math anxiety negatively relates to math performance. This negative\nrelationship may be exacerbated in low-progress math learners. However, there\nare limited studies on math anxiety among low progress learners in a\nparadoxically high performing education system like Singapore. To fill this\nresearch gap, this research analysed the anxiety profiles of 151 students who\nwere in the math learning support intervention program administered by the\nMinistry of Education, Singapore (MOE). We examined the complex relationship\ncentred in math anxiety with relevant variables such as demographic\ncharacteristics, working memory and math performance. Limitations and future\ndirections are discussed.",
